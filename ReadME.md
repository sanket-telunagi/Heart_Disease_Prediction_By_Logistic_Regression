## Dataset :

The dataset consists of 779 individuals data.
There are 15 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 14 columns.

1.	Age : displays the age of the individual.
2.	Sex : displays the gender of the individual using the following   format : 1 = male
          0 = female.
3.	Chest-pain type : displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format :
           1 = typical angina
           2 = atypical angina
           3 = non - anginal pain
           4 = asymptotic
4.	Resting Blood Pressure : displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
5.	Serum Cholestrol : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)
6.	Fasting Blood Sugar : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. 
   If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1  (true)
                                else : 0   (false)
7.	Resting ECG : 
              0 = normal
              1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
              2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
8.	Max heart rate achieved : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
9.	Exercise induced angina : 
              1 = yes
              0 = no
10.	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest : displays the value which is integer or float.
11.	Peak exercise ST segment : 
              1 = upsloping
              2 = flat
              3 = downsloping
12.	Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
13.	Thal : displays the thalassemia : 
              3 = normal
              6 = fixed defect
              7 = reversable defect
14.	Diagnosis of heart disease : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 
              0 = absence
              1,2,3,4 = present.
